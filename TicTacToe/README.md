# Tic Tac Toe - ReactJS Project ðŸŽ®

This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built with **ReactJS**, designed for two players to compete on the same device. The app allows players to enter their names, play the game with real-time updates, and provides options to reset the game or start fresh with new players.
